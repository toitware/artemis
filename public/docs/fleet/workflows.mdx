# Workflows

Artemis is designed to be used with existing tools and workflows for
software development.

Here, we will use Git and GitHub as an example, but the same principles apply
to other version control systems and code hosting platforms.

## Source of truth

Artemis works locally on files, but also uploads data (firmware, configurations)
to the broker. Even though, devices can only see the broker, we consider the
files Artemis works with the "source of truth". In fact, there is not even a way to
retrieve an Artemis fleet configuration (consisting of the `fleet.json` and
`devices.json` files) from the broker.

It is healthy to think of the broker as a "dumb" communication channel between
the devices and the Artemis CLI. All the important data is stored locally.

## Git

Since Artemis works locally, it is a good idea to use Git to keep track of the
changes in the Artemis fleet files. This provides multiple features that
are critical for efficient fleet management:
- Versioning
- Collaboration
- Code reviews
- Continuous integration

Artemis could implement these features itself (and many other fleet management
systems do), but using existing tools is more efficient, flexible and convenient
for the user.

## Typical setup

Artemis doesn't require any specific setup, and for small projects, the following
workflow is clearly overkill. However, for larger projects, or projects that
require the cooperation of multiple developers, the following setup is probably
a good starting point.

### Tasks

When managing fleets, there are two main tasks:
- Firmware development
- Roll out

Both of these should be versioned separately and will therefore live in
their own repositories.

### Development repository

As an example see [this repository](https://github.com/toitware/demo-artemis-pods).

The development repository is responsible for creating
pods ("firmware") that can then be rolled out to the production fleet.

Note that even the development repository should contain a fleet configuration.
For one, Artemis requires one for most of its operations, but also, pod development
typically wants a fleet to test against. Devices in this fleet are typically
in physical proximity to the developers and can be used for testing.

For most projects, the development repository can also contain the source
code that is used to build the firmware. This is not a requirement, and for
larger projects, it might make sense to have a separate repository for the
source code.

#### Continuous integration and releases

As part of the continuous integration, the development repository
builds a new pod at each commit (to `main`), and uploads it. It then
does a roll-out to the development fleet. Depending on the fleet
configuration this affects a subset of the devices (or none).

Developers should then monitor the development fleet to see if the new
pod works as expected.

Once a pod is ready for production, it can be tagged and released. During
this process, the pod is also uploaded to the production fleet. Note, that
this doesn't mean that the pod is rolled out to the production fleet. It
just makes it available for a roll-out.

### Production repository

As an example see [this repository](https://github.com/toitware/demo-artemis-fleet).

The production repository is only responsible for rolling out pods
to the production fleet. It doesn't contain any pod source code.

Changes to this repository might affect lots of devices and should thus be
reviewed and tested carefully.

If things go wrong, it is enough to revert to the previous commit and do
a new roll-out. As long as the devices have some way of connecting to the
broker they will eventually recover to the previous state.
