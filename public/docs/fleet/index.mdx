# Manage your fleet

Artemis is a fleet management system for ESP32 devices running the Toit platform.
It connects your devices to the cloud and makes it possible to seamlessly update
the firmware, containers, and configurations that run on your devices. It is free for
up to ten devices and built to scale.

Artemis is the combination of an on-device service that communicates with a broker
in the cloud &mdash; and the developer tooling to help orchestrate the devices. It is
possible to host your own broker, so all your data and code remains under your
control.

---------------------

# Installation

On your development machine, Artemis is a single command line tool (`artemis`).
You can download it from here:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Windows">

Download [`artemis`](https://github.com/toitware/artemis-releases/releases/latest/download/artemis-windows.zip).

</Tab>
<Tab label="macOS">

Download [`artemis`](https://github.com/toitware/artemis-releases/releases/latest/download/artemis.dmg)
  (or as an [archive](https://github.com/toitware/artemis-releases/releases/latest/download/artemis-macos.zip)).

</Tab>
<Tab label="Linux">

Download [`artemis`](https://github.com/toitware/artemis-releases/releases/latest/download/artemis-linux.tar.gz).

</Tab>
</Tabs>

If you download an archive, you should unpack it and put the embedded `artemis` or `artemis.exe` binary
somewhere on your `PATH`. The same applies when you extract the `artemis` binary from the macOS `artemis.dmg`
file.

The Artemis command line tool is a standalone executable written in Toit. Use `artemis help` for usage help.

## Git

Artemis needs `git` to be installed on your system. On most macOS and Linux systems,
`git` is already installed. On Windows, you can download and install `git` from
[git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

## Signing up and logging in

All users must be authenticated. For OAuth-based authentication you can just
sign up and log into Artemis as follows:

``` sh
artemis auth login --provider=github
```
or
``` sh
artemis auth login --provider=google
```

Alternatively, for email-based authentication, sign up with:

``` sh
artemis auth signup --email=myname@example.com --password=PASSWORD
```

Then, after having confirmed the email address, log in with:

``` sh
artemis auth login --email=myname@example.com --password=PASSWORD
```

Usually, signing up by OAuth is more convenient, but email-based authentication can be useful
if you want to have multiple accounts. For example, with Google domains anything after
the "+" is discarded. So `email+additional@gmail.com` is an alias for `email@gmail.com`.

## Creating an organization

Every device must belong to an organization. You can create as many organizations as
you want (and there will eventually also be a way to remove them again). You can add an
organization using `artemis org create` like this:

``` sh
artemis org create "My Organization"
artemis org show
artemis org members list
```

The `artemis org show` command shows you your organization ID, which is a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

Once you create a new organization it is automatically set as default. You can switch to a different organization with
`artemis org default YOUR-ORG-ID`, or by passing the organization id to the commands that need one.

You can add other users to your organization with `artemis org members add THEIR-USER-ID`. The
user you want to add can find THEIR-USER-ID with `artemis profile show`.

If you want to, you can also change the name in your profile with:

``` sh
artemis profile update --name "My full name"
```

# Getting started

Once you've [downloaded](#installation) the command line tool (`artemis`),
[signed up](#signing-up-and-logging-in), and
[created an organization](#creating-an-organization),
you're ready to put Artemis on a device and manage it via the cloud.

## First steps

Artemis manages fleets of devices. To get started, first you must create
an empty fleet in a suitable directory. Go to the directory and run:

``` sh
artemis fleet init
```

This creates three files: `fleet.json`, `devices.json`, and `my-pod.yaml`.
The `fleet.json` file holds some metadata and the list of devices in `devices.json`
is empty. The `my-pod.yaml` file is the most interesting to get started.

Artemis lets you describe the functionality and configuration of your devices
in [pods](pods), which is a set of containers and the configuration
of the environment they need to run in. Pods can be specified through version control friendly
[specification files](pods#specifications), so let's start with the simplest
possible specification by putting the following content into the `my-pod.yaml` file:

``` yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://toit.io/schemas/artemis/pod-specification/v1.json

$schema: https://toit.io/schemas/artemis/pod-specification/v1.json
name: my-pod
sdk-version: SDK-VERSION
artemis-version: ARTEMIS-VERSION
max-offline: 0s
connections:
  - type: wifi
    ssid: YOUR WIFI SSID
    password: YOUR WIFI PASSWORD
containers: {}
```

The first line is a comment and not required. It helps vscode to find the correct
schema for the file. If the yaml extension is installed, you will get code
completion and diagnostics this way.

If you fill in your WiFi credentials, you have a working specification for a pod
named `my-pod`. To make the pod available to your fleet, you will need to upload
it to your broker:

``` sh
artemis pod upload my-pod.yaml
```

This uploads `my-pod` and gives is a few useful tags, so we can find it later. The
fleet has a `default` [group of devices](/getstarted/fleet/groups) and in the `fleet.json` file, we can specify
that the group uses `my-pod@latest` as its pod. Whenever we upload a pod, its `latest`
tag is automatically updated, so it can be convenient to just refer to that from
the group:

``` json
{
  ...
  "groups": {
    "default": {
      "pod": "my-pod@latest"
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>

Instead of using the convenient `latest` tag, it is often preferable to use tags that do not
change in the `fleet.json` file. This makes it possible to reproduce and reason about the
fleet state at any revision of the `fleet.json` file. So instead of using `my-pod@latest`,
you can use a stable tag like `my-pod@v1.0.2` or `my-pod@20230515175710-broad-method`.

</Note>

To get your functionality onto your device, you flash a device with firmware
`my-pod@latest` by running:

``` sh
artemis serial flash --port /dev/ttyUSB0
```

This flashes the device over the USB serial port and puts both the Toit
platform and the Artemis service onto the device. Once flashed, you
can follow the behavior of your device by monitoring the serial port
using something like `jag monitor`
(included with [Jaguar](../device#2-install-jaguar)). It
shows something like this:

``` text

configsip: 0, SPIWP:0xee

[network] INFO: opened
[artemis.synchronize] INFO: connected to network
[artemis.synchronize] INFO: connected to broker
[artemis.synchronize] INFO: synchronized
```

Once you see that the device succesfully connect to the cloud, you should
be ready to check its state:

``` sh
artemis device show
```

Artemis also added your device to your fleet as part of running `artemis serial flash`,
so you can now check the status of your entire fleet by running:

``` sh
artemis fleet status
```

Great! With a little help from the Artemis service and developer tooling,
you have a cloud-managed device capable of running high-level code.

## Tinkering with your device

Artemis allows you to change and tinker with the current state of a device
without requiring a full firmware update. This makes it possible to change
the behavior of a device by adding new functionality (drivers or applications)
or by changing configurations.

Such incremental changes are great for development; especially as they are faster
to get onto the device and do not even require restarting the device. However,
these changes are lost at the next firmware upgrade.

### Controlling synchronization

Devices managed by Artemis need to connect to the cloud to receive updated information.
The frequency at which they synchronize can be configured by the user.

Devices that connect frequently or all the time are easy
to interact with and manage, but they spend a lot of power on staying connected
all the time. The pod specification in the example `my-pod.yaml` does not specify
how often to connect, so Artemis assumes that you want an interactive device.

If you don't need your device to stay connected all the time, you can
give it a 'max-offline' setting. This tells the Artemis service that it is
okay to be offline for 5m, 1h30m, or 24h without necessarily connecting to the
Internet.

You can set this through:

``` sh
artemis device set-max-offline 1m19s
```

If you monitor the output of your device, you'll see that the device goes
to sleep between its cloud synchronizations.

You can go back to the original setting, where the device tries to
stay online all the time by giving it a 'max-offline' setting of 0s:

``` sh
artemis device set-max-offline 0s
```

### Installing code

Artemis makes it easy to install and uninstall new code on your devices.
The code that you install runs in containers, so they are isolated from
the rest of the system and can be started and stopped independently of
the other parts of the system.

To install new code on your device, you can install a new named container
based on a Toit source file:

``` sh
artemis device container install hello hello.toit
```

The container name `hello` does not have to match the source file
name `hello.toit` and you will use the container name to refer to
the installed container later. There can only be one container with
a given name on a device, so installing another one will replace
the original.

By default containers will run when installed and whenever the
device boots, but you can control this behavior by specifying the
triggers on the command line. If you *only* want to run when booting,
you can do:

``` sh
artemis device container install --trigger boot hello hello.toit
```

You can also get Artemis to run your containers on a schedule
by triggering them at a specified interval. As an example, you can
install the `hello` container and get it to run every 10s
like this:

```sh
artemis device container install --trigger interval:10s hello hello.toit
```

Any arguments you pass to `artemis device container install` after the
source file will be passed as string arguments to `main`. If you put
this in `args.toit`:

```
main args:
  print "arguments = $args"
```

and run:

``` sh
artemis device container install args args.toit foo bar
```

you should see `arguments = [foo, bar]` printed.

Finally, you can always uninstall a container again using:

``` sh
artemis device container uninstall hello
artemis device container uninstall args
```

## Updating a single device

If you want to update to a new version of the Toit SDK or benefit from the
latest Artemis release, you can do an over-the-air firmware update. Such
updates are pushed to the broker in a compressed form and picked up by the
device.

Similar to `artemis serial flash`, the over-the-air update command also
uses pods, so the common workflow is to change your pod specification file
to reflect the state you want your device in, and then update it to
that through:

``` sh
artemis pod upload my-pod.yaml
artemis device update my-pod@latest
```

You can specify which device to update using a device-id flag (`-d`), but most
of the time you just use the default ID that was either set
during flashing, or that can be set with `artemis device default`.

## Rolling out changes to a fleet

If you've modified the `my-pod.yaml` file and you want to make the changes available
to your fleet of devices, you can upload the latest version of your pod using:

``` sh
artemis pod upload my-pod.yaml
```

If your `fleet.json` uses `my-pod@latest`, you can ask the fleet
to roll out the changes to your devices using:

``` sh
artemis fleet roll-out
```

If you changed the pod reference in `fleet.json` to use a stable tag, then
you need to update that before you run `artemis fleet roll-out`:

``` sh
artemis fleet group update --tag v1.0.3
```

Because your pods encapsulate the fully configured firmware, this makes
it easy to upgrade your containers, the Artemis service, and even the Toit SDK
and its associated virtual machine.
