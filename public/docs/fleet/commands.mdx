# Commands

## `artemis serial flash`

The flash command converts your specification file into a binary firmware and
flashes it onto your device using a bundled version of
[`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool).

Unless you are on Linux you will probably need to change the `/dev/ttyUSB0` to your
setup.  Sometimes the name is `/dev/ttyACM0`, depending on which USB-to-serial driver
your computer is using.

On some ESP32 devices, you need to press a button to flash it over USB.

If the flashing doesn't work you might still end up with a provisioned identity, that
isn't used. We will improve this situation, but for now don't worry about it.

To access `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux you probably need to be a member
of some group, normally either `uucp` or `dialout`.  To see which groups you are
a member of and which group owns the device, plug in an ESP32 to the USB port
and try:

``` sh
groups
ls -g /dev/ttyUSB0
```

If you lack a group membership, you can add it with

``` sh
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
```

You usually have to log out and log back in for this to take effect.

## `artemis device show`

You can always see the status of your device by doing `artemis device show`. It shows
useful information about a device, including its state and recent events:

``` text
% artemis device show -d xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx --max-events=6
Device ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
Organization ID: yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy

Firmware state as reported by the device:
  apps:
    cellular:
      id: bad371bf-af6d-5188-0da4-ac3a3b98d3a2
      triggers:
        boot: 1
      background: 1
  firmware: eyNVAlUPZGV2aWNlLXNwZWNpZmljWyRVI0kB1nsj...QXu7oV/CJX94Q3P0Ae/Vau/XsWL7JJl1iWSw0w==
  connections: [{type: cellular, config: {cellular.apn: soracom.io, cellular.uart.rx: 23, cellular.uart.tx: 5, cellular.uart.cts: 18, cellular.uart.rts: 19, cellular.log.level: 1}}, {ssid: ..., type: wifi, password: ...}]
  max-offline: 300
  sdk-version: v2.0.0-alpha.69

Goal is the same as the reported firmware state.

Events:
  15:17:12.981 get-goal
  15:12:05.228 get-goal
  15:01:43.273 get-goal
  15:01:41.943 update-state
  15:01:28.073 update-state
  15:00:34.871 get-goal
```

You can use the events as a primitive health monitoring facility and see when
the device synchronize from the cloud (`get-goal`) and to the cloud (`update-state`).
