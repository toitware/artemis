# Pods

Artemis allows you to build and distribute pods (as in a pod of whales or pea pod).
A pod is a set of containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a
description of how to run the containers. Pods are built from declarative specifications
and they form the basis of Artemis' synchronization mechanisms.

## Building

Pods are built from [specifications](#specifications). Once built, the pods are
self-contained and have no external dependencies. This makes them ideal for
deployment and for archiving. To build a pod from a specification, you invoke
the `artemis pod build` command like this:

``` sh
artemis pod build -o my-pod.pod my-pod.yaml
```

Pods contain symbolic debug information, so it is useful to keep them around
after having deployed them. This is easy to achieve by [uploading](#uploading)
them to your broker.

## Uploading

Pods are named and they can be uploaded to your fleet using the
`artemis pod upload` command:

``` sh
artemis pod upload my-pod.pod
```

This creates a new revision of the `my-pod` pod and automatically tags it
with the `latest` tag and a generated tag like `20230515175710-broad-method`.
The first component is a timestamp and the last component is a random name
that makes it easier to refer to the generated tag.

You can specify the tags when you upload, so you can associate more meaningful
tags with your pod revisions. It is common to use a versioning scheme for the
tags, so you can compare them more easily using something like [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

To upload `my-pod.pod` with the `v1.0.2` tag, you can use:

``` sh
artemis pod upload my-pod.pod --tag v1.0.2
```

You can upload multiple pods at the same time, so if you have more than one
device group that run your code in different configurations, it is straightforward
to give them the same tag:

``` sh
artemis pod upload group-0.pod group-1.pod --tag v2.0.0-pre.3
```

You can always see the available pods and their tags through:

``` sh
artemis pod list --name my-pod
```

## Referring to pods

You can refer to a pod using its name and revision &mdash; like `my-pod#4` &mdash; but
it is more common to use a tagged reference such as `my-pod@latest` or `my-pod@v1.0.3`.

Such pod references are used when updating or flashing a single device:

``` sh
artemis device update my-pod@v1.0.3
```

or more commonly indirectly through the [groups](/getstarted/fleet/groups) in the `fleet.json` file:

``` json
{
  ...
  "groups": {
    "office": {
      "pod": "wifi-esp32@v2.0.1"
    },
    "solar-farm-fr-nce": {
      "pod": "cellular-esp32s3@2.0.2-pre.7"
    }
  }
}
```

It is also possible to refer to pods by ID and you can find such IDs in pod lists. To
update a device to a pod by ID, you can use:

``` sh
artemis device update 0f587f04-a0e2-5354-ac3d-ceca41a60b63
```

## Specifications

You can find an example pod specification file in
[specification.yaml](https://github.com/toitware/artemis-releases/blob/main/examples/specification.yaml).
It is in YAML format and looks similar to this:

``` yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://toit.io/schemas/artemis/pod-specification/v1.json

$schema: https://toit.io/schemas/artemis/pod-specification/v1.json
name: example
sdk-version: SDK-VERSION
artemis-version: ARTEMIS-VERSION
max-offline: 0s
connections:
  - type: wifi
    ssid: YOUR-WIFI-SSID
    password: YOUR-WIFI-PASSWORD
containers:
  hello:
    entrypoint: hello.toit
  solar:
    entrypoint: examples/solar_example.toit
    git: https://github.com/toitware/toit-solar-position.git
    branch: v0.0.3
```

The `$schema` entry links to the JSON schema of the specification and is also
used as versioning mechanism. This entry is mandatory and identifies Artemis
pod specifications.

The `name` is optional and is computed from the name of the file it is absent.

The two version entries are for the SDK and Artemis versions. Be aware that not
all combinations of those are supported. Use `artemis sdk list` to see the
valid combinations.

The `max-offline` entry is optional and defaults to 0s. Use it to control for how
long your device is allowed to stay offline.

The `connections` section contains a prioritized list of ways to connect to the
Internet. You can have multiple `wifi` entries and Artemis will attempt to
connect to them in the specified order.

It is also possible to have `cellular` entries in `connections`, but for that to
work you'll need to have a cellular driver installed as one of your containers.
You can find a few drivers in the [cellular package](https://github.com/toitware/cellular).

The `containers` section contains named entries for the containers
you want on your device. The containers that are built from source
code have an `entrypoint` that refers to the file that has the
`main` method. You can optionally pull the source code directly
from git using `git` and `branch`.

If your container is a driver or provides services for other
containers, you probably want to start it on boot and let it
run until no other container runs. For that to work, you can
make it a background container that is automatically terminated
when the device goes to sleep like this:

``` yaml
containers:
  cellular:
    entrypoint: src/modules/sequans/monarch.toit
    git: https://github.com/toitware/cellular.git
    branch: v2.1.12
    background: true
    critical: true
```

The `critical` flag makes the container run continuously. Only containers that are needed
for the proper functioning of Artemis should be marked as critical. Typically, this is
only the cellular driver.

The `background` flag tells Artemis that the container does not keep the device awake. If
there are only background containers running, the device will go to sleep.

If you want your container to run periodically, you can specify interval
triggers in the `containers` section like this. Frequently, containers that should run
continuously are also marked as running periodically with a very low timeout (like 1s). If they
ever crash or exit, then they will be restarted.

``` yaml
containers:
  measure:
    entrypoint: measure.toit
    triggers:
      - interval: 20s
```
