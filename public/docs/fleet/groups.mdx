# Device groups

Artemis allows you to organize your devices in groups. Each group has an
associated remote pod reference. This allows Artemis to determine which
pod a device is supposed to run.

Device groups are defined in the `fleet.json` file:

``` json
{
  ...
  "groups": {
    "office": {
      "pod": "esp32-wifi@v1.0.3"
    },
    "solar-farm-fr-nce": {
      "pod": "esp32s3-cellular@v1.0.3"
    }
  }
}
```

When flashing a device, you can decide which group the device belongs
to by using the `--group` argument:

``` sh
artemis serial flash --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --group office
```

From this point forward, the device knows which group it belongs to
so if the pod of its group is changed, Artemis will push an update
to the device when requested to roll out the changes to the fleet:

``` sh
artemis fleet roll-out
```

<Note>

If the `fleet.json` file contains a group named `default`, it is used
for any device where you do not specify its group when you flash it.

This is convenient for small homogenous fleets where not having to
worry about groups at all simplifies things.

## Creating groups

To create a new group, you can edit the `fleet.json` file or simply use:

``` sh
artemis fleet group create solar-farm-dk-aar
```

This creates a new group based on the same pod as the `default` group.
You can optionally specify the pod for the new group by passing
a `--pod` argument like this:

``` sh
artemis fleet group create solar-farm-dk-aar --pod esp32s3-cellular@v1.0.3
```

It is also possible to use a non-default group as a template. In this case,
the settings for the existing group are copied to the new group:

``` sh
artemis fleet group create solar-farm-dk-aar --template solar-farm-fr-nce
```

## Deploying to groups

The most common operation on groups is to update the pod they are based
on to prepare for deploying changes to your fleet:

``` sh
artemis fleet group update --pod esp32s3-cellular@v1.0.4 solar-farm-fr-nce
```

You can also just update the tag and in that case it often makes sense
to do it for multiple groups at the same time:

``` sh
artemis fleet group update --tag v1.0.4 office solar-farm-fr-nce
```

Once you've updated the pod references in your groups, you can use:

``` sh
artemis fleet roll-out
```

to roll out the changes to your devices.

## Renaming and merging groups

Renaming a group is as simple as updating its name:

``` sh
artemis fleet group update solar-farm-dk-aar --name solar-farm-dk-cph
```

To merge two groups, you can move all devices from one group into the
other and remove the empty one:

``` sh
artemis fleet group move --group solar-farm-dk-aar --to solar-farm-dk-cph
artemis fleet group remove solar-farm-dk-aar
```
