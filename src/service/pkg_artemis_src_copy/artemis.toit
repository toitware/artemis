A container is a schedulable unit of execution that runs

The containers on a device are managed by Artemis. They
  are installed and uninstalled when Artemis synchronizes
  with the cloud. After a container has been installed
  on a device, Artemis takes care of scheduling it based
  on its triggers and flags.
